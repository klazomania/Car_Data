# Car_Data

Following project answers a question about a theoretical search engine for the lowest priced car in a specific location. 

Some things that need to be worked on:
      -> vehicleSearch() in main class (driver). Currently is only allowing "Boston" to appear
      -> Use Date() class to implement seasons that determine whether or not there is a pricing premium
      -> in object class (Vehicle) need to build a method that translates MSRP into daily rental pricing
